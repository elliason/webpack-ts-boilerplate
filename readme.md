## Building
Building tool is __webpack__.

We use [@babel-register](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-register) to  allow the Webpack
configuration file to be written using ES6. It requires the file to be named with a .babel.js suffix to work.

We use webpack modes ( development | production ) and presets. 

### Build commands
The default development building task to run is
```yarn dev```
